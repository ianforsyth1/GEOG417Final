WORKFLOW SUMMARY
This lab created a model that will help to determine the most practical area to place a new species of jackrabbit
given certain parameters. The model was applied to our map to determine those eligible areas for use by the Park
Service. Eligible allotments have been optimized and outlined in accordance with the data provided.
